    <h3>a sad announcement</h3>
    <p>Hi all, I just wanted to let you know that Mikayla Raines, the owner of the Saveafox YouTube channel, took her own life a few days ago. This hits hard for me as someone who has considered doing that in the past when going through a hard time. Like her I also have autism and to the people who bullied her into this, I hope that you're happy knowing that you basically killed someone. And to everone else, be kind to others. You have no idea what they're going through. I left the link to her channel at the top of this site, go check it out.</p>

    <h3>doge update</h3>
    <p>Scout is still... him... do with that what you will. He's 4 now and still as crazy as day 1. If you ever hear barking in my videos, it's probably him thinking someone is at the front door when 99% of the time no one is there.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="blog-post">
    <h3>First Blog Post – What Even *Is* This Site?</h3>
    <p>Okay so, I made this thing because I needed a place to yell about tech stuff, show off my repairs, and maybe talk about life too. If you're here, congrats, you're one of like 3 people who found it.</p>
